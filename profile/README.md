# Knowledge Silo

Note: This is a work in progress. There's nothing to see here at the moment.

I'm calling it [silo]([silo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo)). It's the most
fitting name I could think of. That doesn't necessarily mean that the software 
architecture will resemble an actual silo, it's just the concept of storing and 
retrieving things, which in this case is information. Authoring is not necessarily 
the main goal although there will be exceptions.

I don't really have the final shape of this project yet. In fact, I don't
even know what the prototype(s) will look like.
